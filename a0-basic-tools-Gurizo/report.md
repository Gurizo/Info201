This visualization shows the summary of 2000 screenplays broken down by gender and age. It is created by Hanah Anderson and Matt Daniels, who are the founders of The Pudding, a data journalism start-up in 2017. It is evident that there are numerous screenplays which are male-dominant while there is only few with 100% of words from female. 

According to *Data Feminism*, 
> "in this book, we pay particular attention to inequalities at
the intersection of gender and race. This reflects our location in the United States,
where the most entrenched issues of inequality have racism at their source."
