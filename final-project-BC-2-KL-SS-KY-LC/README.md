# Introduction
Project Overview
Our project aims to analyze the factors that influence passenger satisfaction in the airline industry and provide insights on how it can be improved. We also explore whether passenger expectations differ based on gender, age, and flight classes, and investigate the impact of flight distance on passenger evaluations.

Major Questions
- What factors would influence passenger satisfaction?
- How can it be improved?
- Are passengers’ expectations different depending on their gender and age?
- Is passenger satisfaction different depending on flight classes?
- Does a long flight distance lead to a negative evaluation?

Data Source
You can find the original dataset on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/binaryjoker/airline-passenger-satisfaction

Ethical Considerations
Using the dataset for commercial purposes of other airlines may raise ethical concerns and harm the specific airline from which the data originated. It is crucial to draw careful conclusions and avoid confounding results or false information that could mislead future judgments. The dataset's limitations include the anonymity of the data source, which limits its credibility, and the lack of detailed feature descriptions.

Implications
The findings from this project can be valuable for technologists, designers, and policymakers in improving airline travel. By understanding the factors that influence passenger satisfaction, designers can make informed decisions about features to include or remove in order to enhance the customer experience. Factors like flight distance can be analyzed to determine the maximum distance before customer satisfaction declines, leading to better flight design and customer loyalty.

Limitations & Challenges
This project does not address pre-existing personal biases, gender nonbinary considerations, and the influence of the airport itself. The dataset primarily consists of loyal customers, potentially leading to higher ratings for the airline. It also categorizes individuals into gender binaries, overlooking those who identify outside these categories. Additionally, the data does not capture the service quality within the airport, such as airport layout, ease of finding gates, or efficiency in baggage claim.


# Conclusion / Summary Takeaways
On analyzing the dataset of airline passenger satisfaction, several major takeaways emerge that shed light on specific aspects of the analysis. The following three key findings provide valuable insights for understanding passenger satisfaction and improving airline services:

Influence of Flight Distance on Passenger Satisfaction:
One surprising discovery is that passengers tend to be more satisfied with long-distance flights compared to short-distance flights. This finding challenges the assumption that longer flights may lead to greater fatigue or discomfort. Instead, it suggests that factors other than flight duration, such as inflight service quality, play a more significant role in shaping passenger satisfaction.

Importance of Inflight Service:
The analysis reveals a strong correlation between passenger satisfaction and inflight service. Passengers who are provided with amenities such as food and drink, inflight entertainment, and WiFi services tend to report higher satisfaction levels. This underscores the significance of inflight service offerings and suggests that airline companies should prioritize enhancing these aspects to improve customer satisfaction.

Flight Class and Passenger Satisfaction:
The graph illustrating the flight class of passengers indicates that individuals with higher class accommodations tend to have a higher satisfaction rate. This finding highlights the impact of flight class on passenger experience, implying that airlines should focus on providing a comfortable and premium experience for customers across all flight classes.

Additionally, the analysis uncovers a noteworthy difference in satisfaction levels between younger and older generations. The data suggests that the younger generation tends to exhibit higher dissatisfaction rates compared to the older generation. This finding underscores the importance of understanding the varying expectations and preferences of different demographic groups and tailoring services to meet their needs effectively.

In conclusion, this project demonstrates that passenger satisfaction in the airline industry is influenced by various factors, including inflight service quality, flight distance, and flight class. By emphasizing the significance of these aspects, airline companies can make informed decisions to enhance their services, bridge the gap between passenger expectations and experiences, and ultimately improve customer loyalty and satisfaction.
